# wldash

![screenshot](https://git.sr.ht/~kennylevinsen/wldash/blob/master/assets/screenshot.jpg)

A dashboard/launcher/control-panel thing for Wayland. Requires wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1.

Consider this alpha-quality: While it works, *everything* is subject to change with a moments notice. You may end up pulling in the latest changes, and *poof*, wldash suddenly turns into an artisan espresso machine.

## How to use

1. Checkout: `git clone https://github.com/kennylevinsen/wldash`
2. Build: `cargo build --release`
3. Put somewhere: `cp target/release/wldash /usr/local/bin/wldash`
4. Run: `wldash`

To generate a new default configuration, run `wldash --write-default-config`. To configure, edit `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wldash/config.yml` (or if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set, `~/.config/wldash/config.yaml`).

To regenerate the desktop file cache, run `wldash --desktop-refresh`.

For more info, look in `src/config.rs`.

## System dependencies

`dbus`. See https://github.com/diwic/dbus-rs#requirements.

## How to use launcher

The launcher for wldash is built-in, based on https://github.com/kennylevinsen/dot-desktop. Pluggable systems may come back in the future.

The environment variables `XDG_DATA_DIRS` and `XDG_DATA_HOME` are read to find the many `applications` folders that contain `desktop` files.
